In this project, I worked with 16 real-life optimization problems; constructed their mathematical models, and found their
optimal solution using CBC and CPLEX solver by employing AMPL software and the PuLP library of
Python.

The file "Linear Optimization Problems" in the repository includes the aforementioned problems and explains them briefly.
