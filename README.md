# Linear & Integer Optimization using Python PuLP and AMPL

In this project, I worked with 16 real-life optimization problems; constructed their mathematical models, and found their
optimal solution using CBC and CPLEX solver by employing AMPL software and the PuLP library of
Python.

The file "Linear Optimization Problems" in the repository includes the aforementioned problems and explains them.

I cannot share the codes for these problems as they are a part of the Indian Institute of Management (IIMA)'s curriculum and hence I am not allowed to upload them online due to academic integrity issues. Please contact me for other information on these problems.
